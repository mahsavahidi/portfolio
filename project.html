        <h1>But let's take a look at the projects that I worked on :D</h1><br><br>
        <h3>This is where I started my journey, landing page</h3>
        <p class="p">Unfortunately now its server is down because they don't use it anymore. but I can serve you a photo :)</p>
        <img src="abtesting1.jpg" />
        <img src="abtesting2.jpg" />
        <p class="p">It looks simple right?? but it was not as simple as it looks for me when I started.</p><br>

        <h3>The next one was another landing page:</h3>
        <p class="p">Booooooooooring</p>
        <img src="scanbarg1.jpg"/>
        <img src="scanbarg2.jpg" /></body><br>
        <p class="p">But this one was a little bit juicy, Because I had to make it responsive</p>
        <img src="scanbarg3.jpg" />
        <p class="p">Sorry if you can't understand the menu language. It's Farsi by the way</p>

        <h3>Here is when I started Python journey</h3>
        <p class="p">I started with Flask and used MySQL as database</p>
        <a class="p" href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/mahsavahidi/Abmyapp/1.0.0" target="_blank">If you click here you can find its schema</a>
        <p class="p">And here is a piece of code:</p>
        <img src="abmyapp1.png" />
        <p class="p">If you need more, here is the part that I am proud of :)</p>
        <img src="abmyapp2.png" />

        <h3>After that I did the same because I was working in the same field.</h3>
        <p class="p">By the way there is no need to say that I tried to code better. Like having a better logic, try to be more clean and use new methods ant stuff. This is what happens for every developper.</p>

        <h1>And that was pretty much it. Chax</h1>
